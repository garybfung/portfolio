      <span class="label color-grey space-m">Product designer<br>3 Months, 2O22</span>
      <h2 class="p-title content-ch-large space-xxs">Overview</h2>
      <p class="content-ch-large">Calico is a seed startup that raised 2 million to build a product lifecycle management platform for fashion companies. Their software helps design-focused brands manage everything from sourcing materials, collaborating with factories and tracking on-going orders.</p>
      <p class="content-ch-large space-m">I joined Calico as the first product designer where I led product and design initiatives from discovery to development.</p>
      <h2 class="p-title content-ch-large space-xxs">Challenge</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Empower brands scale from one person to a small product team</li>
        <li>Improve sustainability efforts in the fashion industry</li>
      </ul>

  <div class="section-green">
    <span class="label space-xxs color-lightgrey">People problem</span>
    <span class="p-large">Fashion product teams feel unorganized and stressed as production process becomes hard to understand. Often times, decisions can be made without product specs being updated.</span>
  </div>

  <div class="section-black">
    <div class="content-area">
      <span class="p-title space-xxs color-white">How do physical products get made?</span>
      <p class="content-ch-large space-m">Most production processes will follow a typical process where they will: design a concept, find a factory, create samples, produce their product then plan shipping logistics. A typical process, may look like this.</p>
    </div>

      <div class="content-area">
      <span class="p-title space-xxs color-white">How this actually looks like?</span>
      <p class="content-ch-large">From talking to industry experts and researching product development online, we learned that product developer’s responsibilities are designing concepts, selecting materials, providing build specs and collaborating with manufacturers before a product goes to market. A product developer’s workspace will have many materials and prototypes as they prefer to work physically. They will use software such as:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Illustrator/CAD for spec-ing out their products</li>
        <li>Asana or Notion for keeping track of workflow</li>
        <li>Excel spreadsheets to map out measurements</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="content-ch-large">When a product is being manufactured, you’ll have over 50+ people putting together the product meaning your product development needs to be clearly documented.</p>

  <div class="section-white">
    <span class="p-title space-xxs">Why adopting a PLM can be diffcult</span>
    <p class="content-ch-large space-l">We distilled our learnings into specific pain points on why fashion companies hesitate to adopt a PLM:</p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="one-third column">
        <span class="p-title space-xxs">Slows down production</span>
        <p class="space-m">There are two main reasons: Most products that are built are often legacy products meaning different teams are using the same product. When a team customizes their inputs, it affects every other team. Also, often times inputting this information is very time-consuming due to the complex user experience.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="one-third column">
        <span class="p-title space-xxs">Locked inside the platform</span>
        <p class="space-m">Product lifecycle software are often designed to retain users by making it hard to migrate data to a new product. However, many manufacturers may need an exported spreadsheets, such as sizing tables or material breakdowns, in order to produce the desired product. Most fashion brands will keep their data on spreadsheets to avoid situations where their business will run on a legacy platform.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="one-third column">
        <span class="p-title space-xxs">Production processes aren’t linear</span>
        <p class="space-m">Many product companies will have different ways of building products such as customizing an existing design pattern provided by a manufacturer to building products from scratch. Current PLMs don’t support tracking feedback and files from factories and stakeholders in a consumable way. For example, many materials could be documented better so different fashion designers can re-use them.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section-green">
    <span class="label space-xxs color-lightgrey">Opportunity</span>
    <span class="p-large">We focused on simplifying the fields and bringing complexity where its needed to differientiate the product from existing PLMs.</span>

    <div class="content-area">
      <span class="p-title space-xxs">Creating Products</span>
      <p class="content-ch-large space-m">The first action for a user is to create a product. The purpose of creating a product is so you can track its progression through sampling and production orders. You’ll be able to add any information similar to a Techpack.</p>

      <span class="p-title space-xxs">Bill of Materials and Material Library</span>
      <p class="content-ch-large">The Bill Of materials (BOM) is used to track materials used in production. This includes materials from base material to packaging. From the BOM, many other functional documents can be made such as a cost breakdown and material checklist.</p>
      <p class="content-ch-large space-m">A material library allows brands can contact previous suppliers and track data for each material.</p>

    <div class="content-area">
      <span class="p-title space-xxs">Product feedback alongside specs</span>
      <p class="content-ch-large">PLMs solve feedback differently. For example, Backbone uses a comment tool only from the brand side. For Calico, we decided to bring in comments for all product related feedback.</p>
      <p class="content-ch-large space-m">In our user interviews, we learned that users would like to move between comments and product specs—so we added a split screen view.</p>

      <p class="content-ch-large">As the first designer, I setup Figma components and design handoff processes so that new designers can be quickly onboarded. The most difficult part about working in fashion product development and supply chain is the industry knowledge designers need to accumulate.</p>

        <span class="p-title space-xxs">Set up your foundations</span>
        <p class="space-m">The most important part about building products is setting up foundations. It can be anything from design systems, project scopes to personal goals. By making your life easier in the future, you will feel less burnout and be able to figure out then execute on the highest impact initiatives.</p>

      <div class="one-half column">
        <span class="p-title space-xxs">Empower the team</span>
        <p class="space-m">The most important lesson I learned at Calico was to empower the team. Sometimes that may mean doing extra documentation for handoff or being that person to remind the team to keep going even if it is difficult. I learned that the highest impact people can achieve that by helping their team multiply their impact.</p>
