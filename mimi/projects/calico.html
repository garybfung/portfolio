    <div class="main">
      <p class="p-large content-ch-large space-l">I joined as the first product designer where I helped define product strategy, set design foundations and build the core product.</p>
      <p class="p-large content-ch-large space-l">The core product is a product library where brands and suppliers can keep track of their design specs and any supporting documents. To provide more value, we built factory marketplace, quotations and order management features to support the workflow between a brand and a supplier.</p>

      <h3>Fashion supply chains are different</h3>
      <p class="content-ch-large">Most production processes will follow a <a href="https://www.shopify.com/ca/blog/product-development-process">typical process</a> where they will: design a concept, find a factory, create samples, produce their product then plan shipping logistics. Fashion follows the same workflow. However, they often need to ship products every month or season, with new designs.</p>
      <p class="content-ch-large space-m">Most supply chains are focused on shipping logistics such as technology or hardgoods because they’ll often be re-ordering existing goods, but in fashion, most of your product collections will only be produced once. Along with this, fashion brands will have a list of different suppliers who specialize on specific products or fabrics.</p>

      <h3>Defining the product journey</h3>
      <p class="content-ch-large space-s">The largest problem in fashion production is collaborating with a supplier. Most of the communication is done through email and whatsapp, so documents and decisions get lost. Suppliers want a concise view of the project as they pass it to different teams to plan logistics. Fashion brands want to be able to iterate and track the project so they can have a clear go-to-market strategy and build great products.</p>

    <div class="content-area">
      <p class="content-ch-large space-l">The core product is the product database which is a centralized place for product iteration between brands and suppliers. Foundational product data would be used in specific ways such as <a href="https://www.optiproerp.com/blog/10-types-boms-explained/">Bill of materials</a> being exported into simplified versions or new variations with specific needs.</p>

      <p class="content-ch-large">Throughout Calico, we looked into a lot of different products from data-intense, PLMs and ERPs. Here are some examples of them and what we thought was interesting.</p>
