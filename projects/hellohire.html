        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p class="space-m">For 6 months, I worked as the sole product designer for Hellohire, where I improved the career fair experience, delivered the event maker, and helped define the product vision. When I joined, Hellohire had an initial product focused on delivering virtual events.</p>
        <h3 class="space-xs">Key Highlights*</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Designed multiple north star prototypes to guide vision</li>
          <li>Improved on existing product to host events with 100+ people</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Target market & User</h3>
      <p class="space-xs">We chose a target market so we could iterate and test the product. From running events in underserved roles to popular roles, we quickly learned that the problem with underserved roles was that they didn't get enough applicants. We believed that improving engagement for these roles was difficult and perhaps a goal for the future. Two markets that we felt were large enough, tech-friendly, and people-focused were:</p>
      <ul class="space-l">
        <li><span class="bold">Customer service Jobs (ex. Starbucks barista, Ski Resort Lift Operators):</span> As Covid lockdowns were ending, there would be a lot of roles to be filled in Malls, Shops and resturaunts. Hellohire could help them reduce scheduling efforts, Assessing candidates, etc…</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Retail Jobs (ex. Sales associate, Warehouse associates):</span> From studios to larger retail shops, they will need to hire employees as well due to Covid. In these roles, you can reach higher sales metrics if sales or warehouse associates care about the company and its products.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Entry-level Tech Jobs (ex. Software engineering, Account managers):</span> Remote and tech jobs are becoming more and more popular. Tech companies are scattered across different sectors, so theres value in connecting people with company visions they believe in. Virtual career fairs will enable recruiters to hire remotely.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Problems and opportunities</h3>
      <p>We used before, during, and after to organize opportunities and pain points. Some overarching problems were gathering information before an event, social norms of talking, and user experience issues.</p>

      <h3>Mapping out the user journey</h3>
      <p>The purpose of the user journey was to clearly identify the aha moment and core action so we can get users to feel product value as soon as possible. The faster an attendee or recruiter got into a call; the more value we create.</p>

      <h3>Re-thinking the product experience</h3>
      <p>There were many changes that needed to be made so we decided to prototype the next step for the product. I led the design of only the consumer side using a ‘content management system’ approach where people would be able to update and add content.</p>

      <h3>Website explorations</h3>
      <p class="">All events begin with an event posting and a sign-up process. Initially, we used facebook groups and social media as the start of the funnel.</p>
      <p class="space-m">The purpose was to eventually test building a growth loop where the more events we had, the more successful job applicants and companies will be at finding matches.</p>

      <h3>Branding and content for events</h3>
      <p class="">Every event is different. From companies who want to create a lightweight event, larger scale events or hybrid events. By designing for lightweight events, companies can get benefit from the product value as soon as possible. A product like Hellohire needs to have some type of traction before it can scale to a larger company.</p>
      <p class="">The old product required pdfs as content. The assumption was that everyone can create a slideshow and export it as a pdf. I created 6 base sections where it can be re-used like a content management system. We can maybe create event templates or change the order of sections to improve product metrics.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><span class="bold content-ch-large">The stage: </span> Companies can host virtual talks, information sessions or stream their actual stage of this were a hybrid event.</li>

          <h3>Making the events feel lively with chat</h3>
          <p class="">In the old system, Hellohire used pop up notifications to organize events such as stage notifications, event delays and event closing.</p>
          <p class="space-m">We wanted the event to feel more lively and contextual so we created an event chat and private chats. Companies and attendees can chat with each other and communicate the event. The private chat in calls was used to solve any bugs or lags if anything were to happen in a conversation.</p>

          <p class="space-m">For learned that many people spent most of their time waiting to join a private call. We explored a wait list to join a call and scheduling a time slot before an event.</p>

          <h3>Impact</h3>
          <p class="">We hosted multiple events with over 100 people and helped people connect with employers. One of the interviewers mentioned the difference with people writing that they are passionate about versus showing how passionate they actually are when they are chatting.</p>
          <p class="">The prototype was not shipped during my time there. However, it helped clarify the product direction for Hellohire.</p>
