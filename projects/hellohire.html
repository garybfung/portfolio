        <h2 class="p-title">Overview</h2>
        <p class="serif space-xs">For 6 months, I worked as the sole product designer for Hellohire, where I improved the career fair experience, delivered the event maker, and helped define the product vision. When I joined, Hellohire had an initial product focused on delivering virtual events. As Hopins began to become the "do everything" company in the industry, Hellohire decided to specialize in recruiting events. Initially, Hellohire's target market was trade shows in underserved markets.</p>

      <div class="content-right-area">
        <h2 class="p-title">Focusing on a market</h2>
        <p class="serif space-xs">We chose a target market so we could iterate and test the product. From running events in underserved roles to popular roles, we quickly learned that the problem with underserved roles was that they didn't get enough applicants. We believed that improving engagement for these roles was difficult and perhaps a goal for the future. Two markets that we felt were large enough, tech-friendly, and people-focused were:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="bold">Customer service Jobs (ex. Starbucks barista, Ski Resort Lift Operators):</span> As Covid lockdowns were ending, there would be a lot of roles to be filled in Malls, Shops and resturaunts. Hellohire could help them reduce scheduling efforts, Assessing candidates, etc…</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Retail Jobs (ex. Sales associate, Warehouse associates):</span> From studios to larger retail shops, they will need to hire employees as well due to Covid. In these roles, you can reach higher sales metrics if sales or warehouse associates care about the company and its products.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Entry-level Tech Jobs (ex. Software engineering, Account managers):</span> Remote and tech jobs are becoming more and more popular. Tech companies are scattered across different sectors, so theres value in connecting people with company visions they believe in. Virtual career fairs will enable recruiters to hire remotely.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="p-title">Problems and opportunities</h2>
        <p class="serif">We used before, during, and after to organize opportunities and pain points. Some overarching problems were gathering information before an event, social norms of talking, and user experience issues.</p>

        <h2 class="p-title">Mapping out the user journey</h2>
        <p class="serif space-xs">The purpose of the user journey was to clearly identify the aha moment and core action so we can get users to feel product value as soon as possible. The faster an attendee or recruiter got into a call; the more value we create.</p>

        <h2 class="p-title">Setting goals we wanted to achieve</h2>
        <p class="serif space-xs">Building product principles was what I ultimately wanted to do. We built goals for the next prototype that we could eventually translate into product principles. These are the four goals we set for the team to solve next.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Easy to setup events.</li>
          <li>Events need to feel fun and rewarding</li>
          <li>Events should be easy to find out about and share.</li>
          <li>Early product needs to have room to iterate</li>

      <div class="content-right-area">
        <h2 class="p-title">Re-thinking the product experience</h2>
        <p class="serif space-xs">There were many changes that needed to be made so we decided to prototype the next step for the product. I led the design of only the consumer side using a ‘content management system’ approach where people would be able to update and add content.</p>

        <h2 class="p-title">Re-designing the website</h2>
        <p class="serif space-xs">All events begin with an event posting and a sign-up process. Initially, we used facebook groups and social media as the start of the funnel.</p>
        <p class="serif space-xs">The purpose was to eventually test building a growth loop where the more events we had, the more successful job applicants and companies will be at finding matches.</p>

        <h2 class="p-title">Branding and content for events</h2>
        <p class="serif space-xs">Every event is different. From companies who want to create a lightweight event, larger scale events or hybrid events. By designing for lightweight events, companies can get benefit from the product value as soon as possible. A product like Hellohire needs to have some type of traction before it can scale to a larger company.</p>
        <p class="serif space-xs">The old product required pdfs as content. The assumption was that everyone can create a slideshow and export it as a pdf. I created 6 base sections where it can be re-used like a content management system. We can maybe create event templates or change the order of sections to improve product metrics.</p>

          <li><span class="bold">The stage: </span> Companies can host virtual talks, information sessions or stream their actual stage of this were a hybrid event.</li>

        <h2 class="p-title">Chat system</h2>
        <p class="serif space-xs">In the old system, Hellohire used pop up notifications to organize events such as stage notifications, event delays and event closing.</p>
        <p class="serif space-xs">We wanted the event to feel more lively and contextual so we created an event chat and private chats. Companies and attendees can chat with each other and communicate the event. The private chat in calls was used to solve any bugs or lags if anything were to happen in a conversation.</p>
