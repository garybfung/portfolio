        <p class="p-large">I joined as the first product designer for 2 years, where I helped define product strategy, set design fundamentals, and built the core product.</p>
        <p class="p-large  space-xl">The core product is a product library where brands and suppliers can keep track of their design specs and any supporting documents. To provide more value, we built factory marketplace, quotations and order management features to support the workflow between a brand and a supplier.</p>

      <h3>Fashion production is different</h3>
      <p class="space-s">Most production processes will follow a <a href="https://www.shopify.com/ca/blog/product-development-process"> process</a> where they will: design a concept, find a factory, create samples, produce their product then plan shipping logistics. Fashion follows the same workflow. However, they often need to ship products much faster, seasonally or monthly with new designs.</p>

    <div class="content-area">
      <h3>Market and target user</h3>
      <p class="">Calico's target market were small fashion brands that were in search of their first product management tool. Most PLM and ERP systems are sales-driven and up-sold through more configuration. However, many early-stage brands we spoke with were skeptical that product management tools would improve their business.</p>
      <p class=" space-m">Product teams often find that entering data is time-consuming and ineffective for their daily tasks. For example, we learned that forgetting to update data can cost brands millions in production, depending on the size of the brand. This led us to realize that Calico should focus on product teams as product management tools should align teams. To make sure our product worked, we ended up focusing on brands with a single product team.</p>

      <h3>User insights</h3>
      <p class="space-s">By looking into existing products and our own, three main insights that guided the product and design direction were:</p>
      <div class="card space-xs">
        <p class="title-support color-beige space-xxs">User insight #1</p>
        <h4>Configurative software creates more problems.</h4>
        <p class="color-grey remove-bottom-margin">Sales-led software are generally customized to fit existing workflows. Many brands, from our interviews, did not want to adopt workflow or product management software until they had to. This is because experienced product people have seen software like this create more confusion and lose companies revenue.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card space-xs">
        <p class="title-support color-beige space-xxs">User insight #2</p>
        <h4>Product teams want collaboration, not documentation.</h4>
        <p class="color-grey remove-bottom-margin">The goal of product management software is to create alignment between teams and organizations. Many products are built for documentation, not collaboration. We added comments and file sharing because it is critical for product teams and suppliers to communicate and document on-going projects.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <p class="title-support color-beige space-xxs">User insight #3</p>
        <h4>Automated inputs improves speed.</h4>
        <p class="color-grey">Many users did not have the time to do everything perfectly when looking at people use the platform. Documentation can end up feeling endless.</p>
        <p class="color-grey remove-bottom-margin">There were ways we can automate inputs such as taking mobile pictures and uploading them or providing pre-populated fields as often as possible.</p>

      <h3>Defining the product journey</h3>
      <p class="space-s">The largest problem in fashion production is collaborating with a supplier. Most of the communication is done through email and whatsapp, so documents and decisions get lost. Suppliers want a concise view of the project as they pass it to different teams to plan logistics. Fashion brands want to be able to iterate and track the project so they can have a clear go-to-market strategy and build great products.</p>

    <div class="content-area">
      <h3>The core product</h3>
      <p class=" space-l">The core product is the product database which is a centralized place for product iteration between brands and suppliers. Foundational product data would be used in specific ways such as <a href="https://www.optiproerp.com/blog/10-types-boms-explained/">Bill of materials</a> being exported into simplified versions or new variations with specific needs.</p>

    <div class="content-area">
      <h3>Setting up the design system</h3>
      <p class="">As the first designer, I setup the design system so it contained documented components with states and props and figma components. Engineers would create components as they develop the core flows to increase speed and efficiency. This meant that every-time there was a new layout or component, I documented the states and props as best as I could.</p>
      <p class=" space-s">For the design language, many products look complex and difficult to use, so we focused on a simple and clean style—Allowing us to develop the brand while we scale.</p>

      <h3>Creating the product database</h3>
      <p class=" space-xs">The purpose of the product database is to house all the product specs and feedback, so brands can re-visit them in the future. We split the product data into two parts based off how frequently they will change:</p>
      <ul class="space-m">
        <li><span class="bold">Foundational details</span> as a single screen (Name of product, collection, variants, measurements, etc..)</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Iterative</span> as different tabs (Initial sketches, CAD files, Materials, product feedback, etc...)</li>
      </ul>

  <div class="section-white">
    <div class="content-area">
      <h3>Tracking Measurements</h3>
      <p class=" space-m">Product developers would be able to upload an existing measurement template for each product type and include a grading scale. While sampling, Product teams and suppliers would be able to make adjustments based on the working prototypes.</p>
    </div>
    <figure>
      <img src="../images/calico/product-measurements.png" alt="map of the allocated time for a general production person">

  </div>

  <div class="section-white">
    <div class="content-area">
      <h3>Developing a bill of materials</h3>
      <p class="">Bill of materials (BOM) table and the component library are directly connected. This way, brands can build their BOM sheets and also track new components. The BOMs can be exported into other functional spreadsheets that can be used to track material logistics for production to material costs sheets for budgeting.</p>
      <p class=" space-m">In the BOM, you'll be able to match different variants, colours and sizes, of materials that will be used for each colourway in the product. Also, product developers will often audit the material to understand weight, stretchiness and other qualities. This information can be inputed for each material so product teams can revisit materials that were already used or rated highly.</p>

      <h3>Collaborating with internal teams and suppliers</h3>
      <p class="">Every product will go through design reviews and supplier feedback. These comments can be selecting materials, feedback on the silhouette to deciding on the technique used to dye the fabric.</p>
      <p class=" space-xxs">In our field studies, we noticed specific pain-points about commenting and collaboration:</p>
      <ol class="space-m">
        <li>Adding comments without being able to see an image or table.</li>
        <li>Identifying a specific cells inside the tables.</li>
        <li>Understanding what a comment is referring to and being able to navigate there.</li>

      <h3>Impact</h3>
      <ul>
        <li class="p-large remove-bottom-margin">100+ products uploaded by a single fashion brand</li>
        <li class="p-large remove-bottom-margin">Average fashion brand uploaded 3 products added in the first 2 months</li>
        <li class="p-large remove-bottom-margin">~80% users made a note of how intutive and simple the experience felt</li>

    <div class="content-area">
      <h3>Learnings</h3>
      <p class="">My biggest takeaway is to setup foundations early before scaling. Before I worked at Calico, I always thought it meant building a strong core product.</p>
      <p class=" space-xxs">I now understand that its solving any small habits or problems that you won’t be able to solve in the future. As a company or team scales at any stage, everything scales with it. Foundations that I would try to setup are culture, the mission and role responsibilities.</p>
      <p class="color-grey">* This is just an overview of the work I've done at Calico. Please contact me for to learn more about my role, impact and other parts of the product.</p>
