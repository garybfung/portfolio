      <span class="label color-grey space-m">Product designer<br>6 Months, 2O22</span>
      <h2 class="p-title content-ch-large space-xxs">Overview</h2>
      <p class="content-ch-large">Calico is a seed startup that raised 2 million to build a product lifecycle management platform for fashion companies. Their software helps design-focused brands manage everything from sourcing materials, collaborating with factories and tracking on-going orders.</p>
      <p class="content-ch-large space-m">I joined Calico as the first product designer where I led product and design initiatives from discovery to development.</p>
      <h2 class="p-title content-ch-large space-xxs">Challenge</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Empower brands scale from one person to a small product team</li>
        <li>Improve sustainability efforts in the fashion industry</li>
      </ul>

  <div class="section-green">
    <span class="label space-xxs color-lightgrey">People problem</span>
    <span class="p-large">Fashion product teams feel stressed and unorganized as they manage development for multiple products. Product developers’ day-to-day includes providing project updates internally, and collaborating with multiple suppliers.</span>
  </div>

  <div class="section-black">
    <div class="content-area">
      <span class="p-title space-xxs color-white">How do physical products get made?</span>
      <p class="content-ch-large space-m">Most production processes will follow a <a class="color-biege" href="https://www.shopify.com/ca/blog/product-development-process">typical process</a> where they will: design a concept, find a factory, create samples, produce their product then plan shipping logistics. A typical process, may look like this.</p>
    </div>
      <img src="../images/calico/process.svg" alt="map of the allocated time for a general production person">
      <div class="content-area">
      <span class="p-title space-xxs color-white">How this actually looks like?</span>
      <p class="content-ch-large">From talking to industry experts and researching product development online, we learned that product developer’s responsibilities are designing concepts, selecting materials, providing build specs and collaborating with manufacturers before a product goes to market. A product developer’s workspace will have many materials and prototypes as they prefer to work physically. They will use software such as:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Illustrator/CAD for spec-ing out their products</li>
        <li>Asana or Notion for keeping track of workflow</li>
        <li>Excel spreadsheets to map out measurements</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="content-ch-large">When a product is being manufactured, you’ll have over 50+ people putting together the product meaning your product development needs to be clearly documented.</p>

  <div class="section-white">
    <span class="p-title space-xxs">Why adopting production lifecycle management software can be diffcult</span>
    <p class="content-ch-large space-l">We distilled our learnings into specific pain points on why fashion companies hesitate to adopt a PLM:</p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="one-third column">
        <span class="p-title space-xxs">Slows down production</span>
        <p class="space-m">Most PLMs are built without the consideration that there could be multiple product teams in a single company. When a team adds or customizes their data fields, other teams are able to see all the new fields. Also, data input becomes very time consuming overtime.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="one-third column">
        <span class="p-title space-xxs">Locked inside the platform</span>
        <p class="space-m">PLMs are often designed to retain users by making it hard to migrate data to another product. However, many manufacturers may need exported spreadsheets, such as sizing tables or material breakdowns. As a solution, most fashion brands end up keeping their data on spreadsheets to avoid situations where their business will be stuck on a single platform.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="one-third column">
        <span class="p-title space-xxs">Production processes aren’t linear</span>
        <p class="space-m">Many product companies have different production processes such as customizing an existing design pattern provided by a manufacturer to building products from scratch. Current PLMs don’t support tracking feedback and files from factories and stakeholders in a consumable way. For example, many materials could be documented better so different fashion designers can re-use them.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section-green">
    <span class="label space-xxs color-lightgrey">Opportunity</span>
    <span class="p-large space-s">The vision was to build a PLM focused on simplifying data input and bringing complexity where its needed to differientiate the product from existing PLMs.</span>
    <span class="p-large">For our main customer profile, we targeted fashion brands with product teams of 1-5 people and are looking for their first PLM.</span>
  </div>

  <div class="section-white">
    <div class="content-area">
      <span class="p-title space-xxs">Defining the product loop</span>
      <p class="content-ch-large">The main problem in the fashion production is collaborating with a supplier. We designed the product loop to include vetting factories, recieving quotes and samples and issuing new orders.</p>
      <p class="content-ch-large space-s">However, the core product is the product database which is a centralized place for product iteration between brands and suppliers. In the future, foundational product data such as <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bill-of-materials.asp">Bill of materials</a> can be built into sustainability reports or material cost breakdowns.</p>

    <div class="content-area">
      <span class="p-title space-xxs">Building the core product</span>
      <p class="content-ch-large space-m">The first action for a user is to create a product. The purpose of creating a product is so you can track its progression through sampling and production orders. You’ll be able to add any information similar to a Techpack.</p>

  <div class="section-white">
    <div class="content-area">
      <span class="p-title space-xxs">Bill of Materials and Material Library</span>
      <p class="content-ch-large">The Bill Of materials (BOM) is used to track materials used in production. This includes materials from base material to packaging. From the BOM, many other functional documents can be made such as a cost breakdown and material checklist.</p>
      <p class="content-ch-large space-m">A material library allows brands can contact previous suppliers and track data for each material.</p>

  <div class="section-white">
    <div class="content-area">
      <span class="p-title space-xxs">Product feedback alongside specs</span>
      <p class="content-ch-large">PLMs solve feedback differently. For example, Backbone uses a comment tool only from the brand side. For Calico, we decided to bring in comments for all product related feedback.</p>
      <p class="content-ch-large space-m">In our user interviews, we learned that users would like to move between comments and product specs—so we added a split screen view.</p>

    <div class="content-area">
      <span class="p-title space-xxs">Design system</span>
      <p class="content-ch-large space-m">The most difficult part, in my opinion, about working in fashion product development and supply chain is the industry knowledge designers. The design system saved the team a lot of time by aligning with engineers how UI was structured.</p>

    <span class="label space-xxs color-lightgrey">Impact</span>
    <span class="p-large">• 150+ products uploaded by a single fashion brand</span>
    <span class="p-large">• Average fashion brand uploaded 3 products added in the first 2 months</span>
    <span class="p-large">• 80% users made a note of how intutive and simple the experience felt</span>

    <div class="content-area">
      <span class="p-title space-xxs">Learnings</span>
      <p class="content-ch-large">My biggest takeaway is to setup foundations early before scaling. Before I worked at Calico, I always thought it meant building a strong core product.</p>
      <p class="content-ch-large">I now understand that its solving any small habits or problems that you won’t be able to solve in the future. As a company or team scales at any stage, everything scales with it. Foundations that I would try to setup are culture, the mission and role responsibilities.</p>
      <p class="content-ch-large color-grey">* This is just an overview of the work I've done at Calico. Please contact me for to learn more about my role and impact.</p>
