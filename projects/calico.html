        <p class="p-large">Fashion companies ship seasonally, so effective back-and-forth communication with suppliers is critical. On a single platform, Calico is a PLM and ERP platform that helps brands and suppliers communicate product specs and manage production orders.</p>
        <p class="p-large">I joined as the sole product designer where I helped define product strategy, setup design foundations and built the MVP from 0-1.</p>

      <h3>A typical production process</h3>
      <p class="space-xl">Most production processes will follow a <a href="https://www.shopify.com/ca/blog/product-development-process">process</a> where they will: design a concept, find a factory, create samples, produce their product then plan shipping logistics.</p>

      <h3>Market and target user</h3>
      <p class="">Calico's target market were mid-sized fashion brands that were in search of their first plm/erp. Most PLM and ERP systems are sales-driven and up-sold through more configuration. However, many early-stage brands we spoke with were skeptical that product management tools would improve their business.</p>
      <p class=" space-m">Product teams often find that entering and finding data is time-consuming. For example, we learned that forgetting to update product data can cost brands millions in production, depending on the size of the brand. This led us to realize that Calico should focus on product teams as product management tools should align teams. To ensure our product worked, we decided to focus on brands with around 3-5 people in a pivotal decision to hire another product developer or invest a plm/erp tool.</p>

      <h3>User & Market insights</h3>
      <p class="space-s">In the first few months at Calico, as I conducted user interviews, facilitated product workshops, and synthesized secondary research, the team learned three key insights that guided the product and design direction:</p>
      <div class="card space-xs">
        <p class="title-support color-beige space-xxs">User insight #1</p>
        <h4>Configurative software creates more problems.</h4>
        <p class="color-grey remove-bottom-margin">Sales-led software are generally customized to fit existing workflows. Many brands, from our interviews, did not want to adopt workflow or product management software until they had to. This is because experienced product people have seen software like this create more confusion and lose companies revenue.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card space-xs">
        <p class="title-support color-beige space-xxs">User insight #2</p>
        <h4>Product teams want collaboration, not documentation.</h4>
        <p class="color-grey remove-bottom-margin">The goal of product management software is to create alignment between teams and organizations. Many products are built for documentation, not collaboration. We added comments and file sharing because it is critical for product teams and suppliers to communicate and document on-going projects.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <p class="title-support color-beige space-xxs">User insight #3</p>
        <h4>Automated inputs doesn't exist.</h4>
        <p class="color-grey">Many users did not have the time to do everything perfectly when looking at people use the platform. Documentation can end up feeling endless.</p>
        <p class="color-grey remove-bottom-margin">There were ways we can automate inputs such as taking mobile pictures and uploading them or providing pre-populated fields as often as possible.</p>

      <h3>Defining the product journey</h3>
      <p class="">The largest problem in fashion production is collaborating with a supplier. Most of the communication is done through email and whatsapp, so documents and decisions get lost. Suppliers want a concise view of the project as they pass it to different teams to plan logistics. Fashion brands want to be able to iterate and track the project so they can have a clear go-to-market strategy and build great products.</p>
      <p class="space-s">In the product workshops I facilitated, we decided which parts we wanted to improve and how that might affect the entire product development process. Calico sits between financial planning and shipping logistics.</p>

      <h3>The core product</h3>
      <p class=" space-l">The core product is the product database, particuarly the <a href="https://www.optiproerp.com/blog/10-types-boms-explained/">Bill of materials</a>. A simple BOM table can be used for many accumulative documents in production such as costs breakdowns and material ordering checklists. These exportable spreadsheets help make future processes easier.</p>

      <h3>Setting up the design system</h3>
      <p class="">As the first designer, I setup the design system so it contained documented components with states and props and figma components. Engineers would create components as they develop the core flows to increase speed and efficiency. This meant that every-time there was a new layout or component, I documented the states and props as best as I could.</p>
      <p class=" space-s">For the design language, many products look complex and difficult to use, so we focused on a simple and clean style—Allowing us to develop the brand while we scale.</p>

      <p class="color-grey space-m">*In this case study, I'll be showing the product database. This is Calico's core product that will be used throughout its product offerings.</p>
      <h3>Creating the product database</h3>
      <p class=" space-xs">The purpose of the product database is to house all the product specs and feedback, so brands can re-visit them in the future. We based the product database off of a <a href="https://www.bommestudio.com/blog/what-is-a-tech-pack#:~:text=A%20tech%20pack%20is%20a,re%20creating%20to%20your%20manufacturer.">techpack</a>. The techpack data was split the product data into two parts based off how frequently they will change:</p>
      <ul class="space-m">
        <li><span class="bold">Foundational details</span> as a single screen (Name of product, collection, variants, measurements, etc..)</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Iterative</span> as different tabs (Initial sketches, CAD files, Materials, sample feedback, etc...)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Commenting on a measurement table</h3>
      <p class=" space-m">Brands and suppliers can make comments on existing files and tables. The comments can be linked to a specific part of the techpack so its easier to re-visit.</p>

      <h3>Developing a bill of materials</h3>
      <p class="">Bill of materials (BOM) table and the component library are directly connected. This way, brands can build their BOM sheets and also track new components. The BOMs can be exported into other functional spreadsheets that can be used to track material logistics for production to material costs sheets for budgeting.</p>
      <p class=" space-m">In the BOM, you'll be able to match different variants, colours and sizes, of materials that will be used for each colourway in the product. Also, product developers will often audit the material to understand weight, stretchiness and other qualities. This information can be inputed for each material so product teams can revisit materials that were already used or rated highly.</p>

      <h3>Learnings</h3>
      <p class="">My biggest takeaway is to setup foundations early before scaling. Before I worked at Calico, I always thought it meant building a strong core product.</p>
      <p class=" space-xxs">I now understand that its solving any small habits or problems that you won’t be able to solve in the future. As a company or team scales at any stage, everything scales with it. Foundations that I would try to setup are culture, the mission and role responsibilities.</p>
      <p class="color-grey">* This is an overview of the work I've done at Calico for the product database.</p>
