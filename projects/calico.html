      <h3>Problem Space</h3>
      <p>Fashion brands often use existing patterns for product development, combining them with marketing and branding for scaling, but those prioritizing design, quality, or sustainability may require a platform to communicate product specs and track materials.</p>
      <p class="space-s">There are many products in the fashion supply chain space from PLMs, ERPs to innovative solutions like 3d models and 3d printing. However, Fashion companies are missing out on having their specialized product management tool. It may seem like a simple solution and many tech companies are solving this for other industries; however, every industry shares documents with different levels of privacy, revisions and file-types. In fashion, you'll encounter these two main problems:</p>

      <h3>Jobs to be done</h3>
      <p>There are three themes of tasks that need to be accomplished. Both manufacturer and <a href="https://qr.ae/pylPqK">brand</a> need to complete these types of tasks to get a project completed. We used this to inform the product journey for Calico's product strategy and vision.</p>

      <h3>Actionable opportunities</h3>
      <p>Through discovery calls, user interviews and market research, we learned about the market from big corporations to small businesses. We saw how different it was for small businesses to run their companies & how structured processes were for a enterprise company, like Aldo.</p>
      <p>Most of the feedback we received when we talked to brands and manufacturers were about their relationship being difficult to manage. For example, irresponsive manufacturers due to many of them being overworked or uneducated fashion companies because they aren’t physically building products everyday.</p>

      <h3>Layout and userflows</h3>
      <p class="">Most companies use email, messaging app and spreadsheets to communicate, while working at Calico. I used before, during and after framework to understand quickly what each piece of documentation or data is intended to do. For example, the bill of materials is used at multiple stages and in different ways, from planning materials for different colorways to calculating costs.</p>
      <p class="">We had two specific parts in the core product: Product Library & Materials Library. In order to help brands work, we differentiated each part with specific layouts. We added sidebar navigation for the material library because users will be searching multiple materials at the same time. In the product library, there is a lot more information and users will spend more time in a specific product, so we provided them a focused view.</p>

      <h3>Adding comments for product data</h3>
      <p class="">The most difficult part about communication is formality. Depending on the brand and factory, they would need to establish how formal they are in this interaction. In most manufacturer’s perspective, there is no need to be formal because we need to get projects to move faster; if its good enough and the client will take it, we will make it. For Calico’s brands, they wanted control over the product and to build a product they were proud of.. they wanted to get samples and iterate through materials.</p>
      <p class="">We designed Calico through comments because it would increase formality and comments have become a very common pattern. We used Flexport and Jira’s comments as inspiration when designing this.</p>

        <h3>Building a material library</h3>
        <p class="">The material library is a core part of what makes a PLM/ERP for fashion brands. They use this to keep track of their vetted textiles and components & build their products. The material library is directly linked to the bill of materials which represents colorways & the materials used for each variant.</p>
        <p>Tables was a major differentiator so we spent time improving how efficient our tables were compared to other competitors. In Calico, we were able to build a bill of materials table that accurately represented spreadsheets made in the current industry & made data input more efficient compared to spreadsheets.</p>

          <h3 class="space-xs">Outcomes & Next steps</h3>
          <p class="space-xs">We recieved a lot of positive feedback for the design of the product from early adopters. The product database was the core product and most used; however, there were ideas on how to build on top of this:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Creating a textile/supplier library marketplace so brands have access to a library of quality materials sourced by Calico</li>
            <li>Building a markup tool & camera feature so brands can document and share faster</li>
            <li>For enterprise companies, building out costing features to track financials from materials, production and shipping like an erp.</li>
          </ul>
